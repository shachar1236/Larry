# Goal
I want to have an engine that uses node system.
Each node will hove each own properties like we can have a node for static image, animation, text, ui, sound, collision, KinematicBody, empty node.
All the nodes can inherete from other nodes and the base node will be an empty node.
The empty node will only containe a position vector.
You can add to every node it's own script that will be in the language: ...

In the future I will want to have an editor where you can place nodes in the worl and edit them and save it to a file.

I will also want people to create their own shaders to use for preprocessing.

I want to add logging.
## Node types (for now)
